	<p>Our take on Mexican street corn incorporates traditional Nicaraguan flavors. First we grill the cob to char,
         then slather it with a blend of spices and creamy garlic sauce, and top it with Cojita cheese and cilantro.
          Elote is offered as a cob on a stick or off the cob in a bowl. You choose if you would like a side of chips
        covered in our spicy chipotle ranch, garlic crema, or a la carte. </p>

			Our strip steak is marinated with Nicaraguan flavors and grilled to perfection then sliced into bite-sized pieces
			and married with grilled cabbage and onions, fresh tomatoes, and creamy garlic sauce.You choose if you would like a side of chips
			covered in our spicy chipotle ranch, garlic crema, or a la carte.
			Steak Quesadillas are a simple, crowd-pleasing dish that is bursting with flavor owing to quick-cooking, taco-seasoned steak pieces, melty Monterrey Jack cheese, and sautéed onions and peppers.
			The ingredients are combined on the stovetop in a toasted flour tortilla, and supper is ready in less than 30 minutes - from beginning to end!

		<p>
			This is a one-of-a-kind recipe for Mexican beef buns packed with bacon and bananas and baked in a light tomato sauce.
			While beef, bacon, banana, and tomato sauce may seem like an unusual combination, the tastes complement one another rather nicely.
			Beef buns are a hearty home-cooked lunch meal that is traditionally served at la comida.
			The cooking is quite easy, and the outcome is fantastic.

				The banh mi sandwich dish begins with a crispy french bread that is stuffed with soft pieces of roasted pork, pickled veggies, and fresh herbs for a substantial lunch that is vibrant in taste, color, and texture!
				The typical French baguette roll is stuffed with pickled carrots and radish, cucumbers, cilantro, and an array of meats.
				Typically, these sandwiches feature pork, either grilled pork or pate, or a mix of the two.
				Sandwiches are usually smeared with mayonnaise and often include a spicy component, such as finely shredded fresh chilies.

					The banh mi with flank steak is a wonderful sandwich.
					Pickled carrots, fresh cucumber spears, cilantro, and a main protein are all stuffed within a fluffy, toasted bread slathered liberally with mayo in a banh mi.
					These proteins may range from pate to tofu and can be found in a variety of forms.
